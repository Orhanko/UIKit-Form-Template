# UI template for forms made in UIKit

## Basic information

 1. This project combines the use of programmatic UIKit and Storyboard/XiB
 2. It has been made with 4 different forms, and each form has 8 different but still similar views
 3. The project structure was not designed to accommodate 32 view controllers. Instead, 8 view controllers were created, each with a dynamically added layout for each page of the form.
 4. The majority of the user interface (UI) components responsible for data entry are created using XIB files.
 5. This project can be readily customized to meet the specific requirements of the application and can also be integrated into an existing project.

##### Screenshots will be available soon.
